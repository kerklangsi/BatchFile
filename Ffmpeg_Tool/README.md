## How to Use

================================================
[1] Install FFmpeg

```

Choosing install or uninstall shows progress messages:

```bat
Installing FFmpeg...
FFmpeg installed successfully.

```

## Notes

- The script uses the `where ffmpeg` command to detect if FFmpeg is available in your system PATH.  
- After installing or uninstalling, you may need to restart your command prompt or PowerShell window for changes to take effect.  
- The script uses winget to manage FFmpeg installation and uninstallation silently.
